summary: Creating a function to group array elements by a single key using Typescript and Generics
---

## The Problem

At the client level, often times data is received from APIs as an array that needs to be further divided into categories.

Here's an example that may seem familiar to anyone learning modern Front-End development:

```json:Task
{
    "id": "task::xxx01",
    "user": "Alejandro",
    "userId": "user::xxxxxxxxxxxx01"
    "state": "IN_PROGRESS"
}

```

The requirements are to receive these tasks from an API and create a To-Do list, Trello board, or any other
visual abstraction. These requirements usually call for the tasks to be displayed by
categories--different columns, or sections for each status (in progress, done, not started, etc).

## Naive solution - just group by task.state!

Since we know the schema of the objects we will be handling, we can simply create a
`groupTasksByState` helper that will do the trick.

```ts:helpers.ts
export function groupTasksByState(tasks: Task[]) {
  let res: { [k: string]: Task[] } = {}
  tasks.forEach((task) => {
    if (res[task.state]) res[task.state].push(task)
    else res[task.state] = [task]
  })
  return res
}
```

This works. But **only** for this specific Task schema and this specific `state` attribute.
What if the schema changes later? We have the additional side effect of checking this helper function,
which probably resides in a utility folder, easy to overlook.

But, worse, what if we need to group a _completely different_ object schema? By a different key?
Maybe we have `Car` objects that could be grouped by both `Make` and `Year`. We find ourselves
creating 3 or more functions that, in practice, do the exact same thing. So how do we make a generic one?

**We use Type Generics**

## What is the end goal?

First, let's look at what we are trying to achieve, using Javascript first. The syntax for generic
functions can be a bit overwhelming.

```js:helpers.ts
export function groupBy(arr, key) {
    let res = {}
    arr.forEach(item => {
        let curr = item[key]
        if (!res[curr]) res[curr] = []
        res[curr].push(item)
    })
    return res
}
```

We now take the additional `key` parameter, to make the function work for any object array
we pass, and group them by the given key.

## Make it Typescript!

Naturally, we are not satisfied with the function above because it is not type safe, and
we can run into errors when misusing it since we won't have much intellisense for it.

We can use type generics for this, which will make it a bit more wordy but a **lot** more
readable, maintainable, and reusable. Let's refactor the function and add generic types

```ts
export function groupBy<T>(arr: T[], key: keyof T): Record<string, T[]> {
  const res: Record<string, T[]> = {}

  arr.forEach((item) => {
    let curr = item[key] as string // type assertion, to access Record above
    if (!res[curr]) res[curr] = []
    res[curr].push(item)
  })

  return res
}
```

Now the Typescript compiler knows that, when using this function, parameters are the array
`arr` which will be of any type T (generic identifier, sort of like a variable X in math),
and `key` which **must** be a key of that same type, T.

### Usage

You may have noticed we tweaked the return type of our groupBy function a little. It
now explicitly returns a `Record<string, T[]>` which means we have to ensure that the variable
where we store the result is of that type. Since our function is generic, this means that
we have to create a new type for each different object type we want to group.

It looks like this

```ts:taskList.tsx
type GroupedTasks = Record<string, Task[]>

const [tasks, setTasks] = useState()

useEffect(() => {
  fetch(API_URL)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(res => setTasks(groupBy(res.tasks, "state")))
}, [])
```

With this implementation we have a working, type-safe `groupBy` function to use with our
API calls!

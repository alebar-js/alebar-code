summary: Let's make a generic, reusable useLoading hook for our async functions

## The four "states" of data-handling components

Our React component often fetch data from external APIs, using asynchronous

- **Empty state**: often overlooked, happens when data fetch was successful,
  but the content returned was empty. This happens with intended behavior
  such as empty search results, posts with no comments yet, etc.

- **Error state**: one or more errors were found when fetching data. Unlike the empty state,
  this is unintended behavior and as such we want to display an error message to the user

- **Content state**: fetch was successful, and data was retrieved. Normally this is the first
  behavior state that comes to mind, so not much is there to be said here.

- **Loading state**: the fetch function / callback was triggered, but it has not yet finished.
  Depending on the user's connection, server load or client operations performed, this can be
  anything from milliseconds to a couple of seconds. We'll talk about how to handle this state

## Loading State - what we need to know

All of the states we discussed, other than Loading, happen once data has been
fetched, and don't change until some other action triggers a change in their data
sources.

Loading is a bit trickier, because it is a transient state. In most cases, our
components will be loading for a finite amount of time, after which it will switch
to one of the other three major states.

Luckily, in JavaScript/Typescript, we have the Promise interface that allows us to
call functions before and after the Promise has been filled. This way, we can track
our Loading state by setting a React.useState variable when the promise begins executing,
and unsetting it when the promise finishes. It would look similar to this:

```ts:ToDoList.tsx
const ToDoList = (props): ToDoListProps => {
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)   // loading state variable
    const [errors, setErrors] = useState<ErrorMessage[]>()
    const [data, setData] = useState<ToDo[] | undefined>()
    useEffect(() => {
        setLoading(true)    // set loading, start api call
        fetch(API_URL)
            .then((res) => {
                setData(res.data)
            })
            .catch((err) => setErrors(err))
            .finally(() => setLoading(false))   // after api call, unset loading
    }, [])
}
```

In this example, we have a component that handles an API call to fetch `ToDo` items
from an external service. We handle the loading state its own useState variable, and
manually set it / unset it when we start and finish fetching.

However, in a real world application we are often fetching data in many different places,
and sometimes even more than one different type of fetch per component, which would have us
repeat this code multiple times.

## Abstracting the logic to a reusable Hook

We've been taught that in clean code, you **D.R.Y -- Don't Repeat Yourself**. Using hooks and
higher-order functions we can create a custom `useLoading` hook that can return a loading
state and an action trigger for any function we want, as long as it returns a promise.

```ts:useLoading.ts
const useLoading = <T extends (...args: any[]) => Promise<any>>(action: T) => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)     // loading state - returned by function

  const doAction = (...args: Parameters<T>) => {    // action trigger, returned as well
    setLoading(true)
    return action(...args).finally(() => setLoading(false))
  }

  return [doAction, loading] as const
}

export default useLoading
```

In here we have abstracted the logic of setting and unsetting state to this useLoading hook,
and return `[doAction, loading]` as the function trigger, and the reference to the loading
state. The inner function `doAction` will set and unset the loading state before and after
triggering the function, and returns the action itself so that it can be triggered

## Usage scenario

Let's see our useLoading hook in action, consuming it in our example `ToDoList` from above:

```ts:ToDoList.tsx
const fetchData = (url: string): Promise<any> => {
    return fetch(url)
        .then(res => res.json())
        .catch(err => console.error(err))
}

const ToDoList = (props): ToDoListProps => {
    const [doFetch, loading] = useLoading(fetchData)
    const [data, setData] = useState<ToDo[]>()

    const fetchDataFromApi = () => {
        doFetch(API_URL)
            .then((data) => setData(data))
            .catch(err => console.error(err))
    }

    useEffect(() => {
        fetchDataFromApi()
    }, [])

    return <>
        {data.map((todo) => <ToDo {...todo} />)}
}
```

Additionally, we can extract the `fetchData` function to an external file to make our `.tsx`
files have the least code possible, and keep the boilerplate-ish code related to data fetching
in `.ts` files.
